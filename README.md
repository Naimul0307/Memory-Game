### Summary
***
Memory game is a classic game to test the player's ability to memorize each card's place and successfully match pairs in lowest number of moves and time possible. In this version of Memory Game, the card deck is composed of 16 cards, matching up to 8 pairs. The player can only open two cards at the same time, which will remain open only if said cards match. Otherwise, the cards will turn face down again. Game ends when all 8 pairs are matched.
A game powered by vanilla Javascript!

### Goal
***
This project aims to test each student's ability to implement basic vanilla Javascript knowledge (OOJS is not yet contemplated in this project) by using ready-made static, non-interactive html/css files and coding a fully interactive memory game app.  

#### Project specifications
***
##### Game behavior
  - **Memory Game Logic** > The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
  - **Congratulations Popup** > When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
  - **Restart Button** > A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
  - **Star Rating** > The game displays a star rating (from 1 to at least 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display at least 3 stars. After *some* number of moves, it should change to a lower star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a even lower star rating (down to 1).
  - **Timer** > When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
  - **Move Counter** > Game displays the current number of moves a user has made. The number of moves needed to change the rating is up to you, but it should happen at *some* point.

##### Interface Design
- **Styling** > Application uses CSS to style components for the game.
- **Usability** > All application components are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

##### Documentation
- **README** > A README file is included detailing the game and all dependencies.
- **Comments** > Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
- **Code Quality** > Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html).
